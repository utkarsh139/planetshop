                <p>Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest in the Solar System. In English, it is
                    named after the ancient Roman god Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce and communication, and the
                    messenger of the gods. Mercury is classified as a terrestrial planet, with roughly the same surface
                    gravity as Mars. The surface of Mercury is heavily cratered, as a result of countless impact events
                    that have accumulated over billions of years. Its largest crater, Caloris Planitia, has a diameter
                    of 1,550 km (960 mi), which is about one-third the diameter of the planet (4,880 km or 3,030 mi).
                    Similarly to the Earth's Moon, Mercury's surface displays an expansive rupes system generated from
                    thrust faults and bright ray systems formed by impact event remnants.</p>

                <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is a terrestrial planet and is the closest in mass and
                    size to its orbital neighbour Earth. Venus has by far the densest atmosphere of the terrestrial
                    planets, composed mostly of carbon dioxide with a thick, global sulfuric acid cloud cover. At the
                    surface it has a mean temperature of 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F) and a pressure of 92 times that of
                    Earth's at sea level. These extreme conditions compress carbon dioxide into a supercritical state at
                    Venus's surface.</p>

                <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. The surface of Mars is orange-red because it is covered in
                    iron(III) oxide dust, giving it the nickname "the Red Planet".[22][23] Mars is among the brightest
                    objects in Earth's sky, and its high-contrast albedo features have made it a common subject for
                    telescope viewing. It is classified as a terrestrial planet and is the second smallest of the Solar
                    System's planets with a diameter of 6,779 km (4,212 mi). In terms of orbital motion, a Martian solar
                    day (sol) is equal to 24.5 hours, and a Martian solar year is equal to 1.88 Earth years (687 Earth
                    days). Mars has two natural satellites that are small and irregular in shape: Phobos and Deimos.

                    The relatively flat plains in northern parts of Mars strongly contrast with the cratered terrain in
                    southern highlands – this terrain.</p>

                <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. This is
                    enabled by Earth being an ocean world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface
                    water. Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's
                    crust. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust is land, most of which is located in the form of
                    continental landmasses within Earth's land hemisphere. Most of Earth's land is somewhat humid and
                    covered by vegetation, while large sheets of ice at Earth's polar deserts retain more water than
                    Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers and atmospheric water combined. Earth's crust consists of slowly
                    moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce mountain.</p>
